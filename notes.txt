A database transaction is a sequence of one or more database operations that are treated as a single unit of work. It is an essential concept in database management systems (DBMS) and ensures that a set of related database operations are executed atomically, consistently, and durably.

A transaction is typically used to maintain data integrity and consistency in a database, especially in multi-user environments where multiple users may access and modify the same data simultaneously. The properties of a database transaction are often referred to as the ACID properties:
